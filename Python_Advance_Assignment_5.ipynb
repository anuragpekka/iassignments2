    "<b>5. What is the purpose of pseudo private attributes?</b><br>Answer:<br>\n",
    "Within a class method in Python, whenever a method assigns to a self attribute (e.g., self.attr = value), it changes or creates an attribute in the instance (inheritance searches happen only on reference, not on assignment). Because this is true even if multiple classes in a hierarchy assign to the same attribute, collisions are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Psuedo private attribute</i> is created by prefixing the name with double underscores everywhere it is used in the class. It avoids potential name collisions in the instance, but it does not amount to true privacy. If you know the name of the enclosing class, you can still access either of these attributes anywhere you have a reference to the instance by using the fully expanded name\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudoprivate attributes are also useful in larger frameworks or tools, both to avoid introducing new method names that might accidentally hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree and to reduce the chance of internal methods being replaced by names defined lower in the tree. If a method is intended for use only within a class that may be mixed into other classes, the double underscore prefix ensures that the method won't interfere with other names in the tree, especially in multiple-inheritance scenarios."
